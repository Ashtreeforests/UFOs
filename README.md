# UFOs Sightings - JavaScript Analysis

## Project Objective

The client's webpage and dynamic table are functioning properly. However, they would like to be able to perform a deeper analysis of UFO sightings. To do this, they'd like to allow users on their webpage to filter for multiple criteria simultaneously. In addition to date, the dynamic table filters now include city, state, country, and shape. 

## Project Overview

Data stored as a JavaScript array, or list, were used to create a table to visually organize the information. JavaScript functions to loop through data to accurately reflect the current data in the event of updates to the data. This is used to cbuild a table with a customized dashboard. These customizations include the filters for live updates and facilitate a more interactive webpage. 

## Project Results

Site visitors will see the below webpage.

Site visitors can use this filter search by one or more criteria. See the below image for an example of searching by city.

## Project Summary

Although this webpage functions on a basic level for the client's needs, there are a couple issues that can be improved upon. 

* The search fields are case-sensitive
* There is no indication to site visitors that their search criteria has been met after they hit "enter"
* The data is possibly oudated and/or limited

The first and second issues noted above may be alleviated by adding educational verbiage for site visitors. The following are recommendations for continued development to improve the webpage and enhance site visitor experience. 

* Additional customizations such as "click-buttons," dropdown lists, auto-fill function to help guide site visitors to track down the data in scope of their interest
* Additional functionality to export data from a live source across the globe
* Add a "most recent" or "latest news" section to showcase high level sightings
